# QACO SDK

**QoS-Aware COmposition (QACO)** is a process that helps you define, validate, and solve web service composition problems involving tasks, candidate services, constraints, QoS features and optimization preferences. This SDK provides:

- A **rich domain model** for QACO problems (Tasks, Features, Constraints, etc.).  
- A **validation** layer to ensure inputs (QACOProblem, CompositeWebService) and outputs (Binding, BindingSpace) are consistent.  
- An **extendable engine interface** to implement your own QACO algorithms and solvers.

## Features

1. **Domain Model**:  
   - `QACOProblem` ties together a `CompositeWebService` (CWS) and a `Problem` definition.  
   - `CompositeWebService` includes tasks, candidate services, features, and a graph structure.  
   - `Problem` includes constraints (Global, Local, Compose, Conditional, Binding) and an optimization strategy.

2. **Validation**:  
   - Ensures that tasks, features, and constraints reference valid entities.  
   - Checks graph nodes for at least one `START` and one `END`.  
   - Verifies that constraints‚Äô features exist in the CWS and that local constraints do not mix `value` and `outputFeature` incorrectly.

3. **Engines**:  
   - `QACOEngineInterface` is an interface defining two main methods: `solve(QACOProblem)` and `bindingSpace(CompositeWebService)`.  
   - `AbstractQACOEngine` provides a **default validation** mechanism for input and output.  
   - You can extend it with custom algorithms (e.g., metaheuristics, exact solvers).

4. **Bindings**:  
   - The output of the engine is a list of `Binding` objects, each containing `BindingMapping` records that map tasks to candidate services.  
   - A `BindingSpace` can be generated to list all possible or feasible bindings.

## Architecture & Domain Model

Here is a high-level view of the key classes:

- **`QACOProblem`**:  
  - `compositeWebService`: The set of tasks, candidate services, features, and graph.  
  - `problem`: Defines constraints, optimization preferences, etc.

- **`CompositeWebService`**:  
  - `tasks`: A list of `Task` objects.  
  - `candidateServices`: Potential implementations for tasks.  
  - `features`: QoS or other measurable properties.  
  - `graph`: Nodes and edges describing the process flow.

- **`Problem`**:  
  - `constraints`: A list of constraint objects (Global, Local, Compose, etc.).  
  - `optimization`: Preferences (features, weights) and aggregator operations.

- **`Binding`**:  
  - Maps each `Task` to a chosen `CandidateService`.  
  - A solver returns one or more Bindings as the **optimal solution**.

- **`BindingSpace`**:  
  - Contains a collection of possible `Binding` configurations. It is returned by the engine to explore the solution space.

## Installation

### Maven

Add the following dependency to your project‚Äôs `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.example.qaco</groupId>
    <artifactId>qaco-sdk</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Then run:
```bash
mvn clean install
```
This will download and link the QACO SDK into your project.

### Gradle

In your `build.gradle`:
```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.example.qaco:qaco-sdk:1.0.0'
}
```

---

## Usage

### Defining a QACOProblem

```java
import com.example.qaco.domain.QACOProblem;
import com.example.qaco.domain.cws.*;
import com.example.qaco.domain.problem.Problem;

QACOProblem problem = new QACOProblem();

// 1. Create a CompositeWebService
CompositeWebService cws = new CompositeWebService();
Task taskA = new Task();
taskA.setName("TaskA");

CandidateService csA = new CandidateService();
csA.setName("ServiceA");

// Add them to the CWS
cws.setTasks(List.of(taskA));
cws.setCandidateServices(List.of(csA));

// 2. Create a Problem definition
Problem domainProblem = new Problem();
domainProblem.setName("Example Problem");
// Optionally add constraints, optimization, etc.

// 3. Attach them to QACOProblem
problem.setCompositeWebService(cws);
problem.setProblem(domainProblem);
```

### Implementing an Engine

```java
import com.example.qaco.domain.QACOProblem;
import com.example.qaco.domain.binding.Binding;
import com.example.qaco.domain.binding.BindingSpace;
import com.example.qaco.domain.cws.CompositeWebService;
import com.example.qaco.engine.AbstractQACOEngine;

import java.util.List;
import java.util.Optional;

public class MyQACOEngine extends AbstractQACOEngine {

    @Override
    protected Optional<List<Binding>> doSolve(QACOProblem problem) {
        // Custom logic (heuristic, exact algorithm, etc.)
        // Return a list of Binding objects if a solution is found
        return Optional.empty();
    }

    @Override
    protected Optional<BindingSpace> getBindingSpace(CompositeWebService cws) {
        // Generate all feasible bindings for the given CWS
        return Optional.empty();
    }
}
```

### Validations

When you call:

```java
MyQACOEngine engine = new MyQACOEngine();
Optional<List<Binding>> bindings = engine.solve(problem);
```

the **`AbstractQACOEngine`** runs various checks:

1. **CWS** must have at least one task and one candidate service.  
2. **Graph** must have at least one `START` and `END` node (if a graph is provided).  
3. **Constraints** must reference tasks and features actually in the CWS.  
4. **LocalConstraint** cannot have both `value` and `outputFeature` set.  
5. **GlobalConstraint** features must be part of the **Optimization** preferences.  

If any validation fails, an `IllegalArgumentException` or `IllegalStateException` is thrown. In a REST context, you might catch these exceptions and return a `400 Bad Request` with details.

## OpenAPI Specification (Optional)

If you want to expose your QACO engine as a **web service**, refer to the provided **OpenAPI** spec (see [`OpenAPI_spec.yaml`](./OpenAPI.yaml)). It describes:

- **POST** `/qaco/solve` to submit a `QACOProblem`.  
- **GET** `/qaco/solve/{jobId}` to retrieve the solution asynchronously.  
- **POST** `/qaco/bindingSpace` to request a `BindingSpace`.  
- **GET** `/qaco/bindingSpace/{jobId}` to retrieve it asynchronously.

The spec also outlines how **validation errors** are reported (`400 Bad Request`) and how to handle long-running jobs (`202 Accepted`). The spec is deployed as a **Swagger UI** at [here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/JAVIERCAVLOP_1/QACO/).
